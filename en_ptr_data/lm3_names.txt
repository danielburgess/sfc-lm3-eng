J: カラード
T: Colored
E: Prisma
I've renamed this to Prisma since saying Colored has other connotations in English which I'd like to avoid.

J: リイム・ライクバーン
T: Reimu Raikuban
E: Liam Wiebren
Interestingly, the name Liam also has meanings rooted in strength and determination.
His last can be read as "like-burn", and instead of writing literally,
we're going with the (shortened) german "equivalent" that evokes thoughts of burning (hopefully).

J: マテドラル
T: Matedral
E: Matedral [Castle is a Citadel]
Seems to be a blend between the latin "Mater" for "Mother" and "Cathedral" considering the parallels in the story
between the catholic church, and it's prevalence in the story as a literal cathedral or headquarters,
I'd say it fits well.
Matedral "Cathedral" or Matedral Castle will likely be referred to as the "Matedral Citadel".

J: スカルボンバーズ
T: Skull Bombers
E: Bone Bombers
I feel like since the name is a bit more alliterative, it has a more whimsical feel in line with the tone of the story.

J: ボルシチ
T: Borushichi
E: Borscht
Seems to be a reference to the cuisine.

J: ポトフ
T: Potofu
In the past, I may have just replaced this with pot, but it seems like a funny combination of pot with tofu, so it stays.

J: 司会者
T: Shikai-sha
E: Emcee (Maybe Quiz King)

J: ラドック
T: Radokku
E: Raddoc
Playfully combining two ideas. This one seems to combine "rat" and "doctor". I like it.

J: ジャスバン

Not sure what this means. A Language? Seems they speak Jasbanese lol

Ancient culture referring to those who wear certain clothing, or material. Usually red and white.

J: リルル

Charlie's other personality

J: 蒼月

E: Fang

J: ヤゴ
T: Yago

Yago sounds similar to 妖獣 youjuu which is a supernatural beast.
Arifer is a latin cross with aer (of the air) and fer (untamed)
